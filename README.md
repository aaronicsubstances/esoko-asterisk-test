# Assessment Backend Part 2 - Asterisk Demo

This is a console application demonstrating making outgoing call with Asterisk software via the NodeJS ari-client library.

## Instructions for testing

*NB: I tested with Asterisk 16, Cent OS 7 inside Oracle Virtual Box on Windows 11 Home, and Linphone Android app (using SIP account)*.

   1. Create .env file besides the .env.example file, and configure the environment variables as needed. 

   2. Use `npm start` to run application. Any errors as well as events will be logged to the console.
